    "\n",
    "A recommendation system is an information filtering system that seeks to predict the \"rating\" or \"preference\" a user would give to an item. It is widely used in different online business such as Amazon, Netflix, Spotify, or social media like Facebook and Youtube. By using recommender systems, those companies are able to provide better or more suited products/services/contents that are personalized to a user based on his historical behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "Research on recommender algorithms garnered significant attention in 2006 when Netflix launched the Netflix Prize to improve the state of movie recommendation. The objective of this competition was to build a recommender algorithm that could beat their internal CineMatch algorithm in offline tests by 10%. It sparked an intense activity, both in academia and amongst hobbyists. The $1 M prize demonstrates the value that vendors place on accurate recommendations.\n",

    "To build a recommender system, the most two popular approaches are Content-based and Collaborative Filtering.<br><br>\n",
    "The Content-based approach will consist of learning the user's behavior from external information which are provided on the users (like their age, country of residence, ...) and on the items (like in the case of movies: genre, director, year, ...).<br><br>\n",
    "Collaborative Filtering, on the other hand, doesn’t need anything else except users’ historical preference on a set of items. Because it’s based on historical data, the core assumption here is that the users who have agreed in the past tend to also agree in the future.\n",

    "The collaborative filtering approach suffers mainly from scarcity and scalability issues.\n",
    "In order to improve the system's efficiency, a natural approach is dimensionality reduction. The idea is to map the information contained in the rating matrix into a smaller matrix, which would be easier to process. Such a matrix can be obtained using Singular Value Decomposition (SVD). Following this analytical method, any matrix of size n x m can be decomposed as a product of three matrices of sizes <i>n x k</i>, <i>k x k</i>, and <i>k x m</i>.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "<img src=\"img/singular_value_decomposition.png\" width=\"500px\">\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "This decomposition can be easily obtained with a dense matrix, however in our case the result matrices are not defined due to the missing values in our matrix.\n",
    "Although methods exist to fill the matrix with placeholder values in order to obtain a dense matrix (for example by replacing missing values with the user's average rating), some information is lost in the process because missing ratings are part of users' behavior and also convey information.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "Therefore, we choose to use a different method which can be applied to sparce matrices, exploiting the fact that ratings are positive values: Non-negative Matrix Factorization.\n",

    "## <a id=\"sec3-1\"></a> 3.1. Non-negative Matrix Factorization\n",

    "Instead of factorizing our matrix R via SVD, we are trying to find two matrices P and Q directly with the goal that when P and Q are multiplied back together the output matrix R’ is the closest approximation of R and no longer a sparse matrix.\n",

    "where the second term is a regularization term added to avoid overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "To update P and Q, we can use a simple gradient descent algorithm. The gradient is approximated in the first order and the components are updated as follows:\n",

    "\n",
    "Collaborative filtering offers an efficient recommendation capacity, and presents the major advantage to require no external information on users or items apart from previous ratings.\n",
    "However it shows a few limitations:\n",
    "- The latent features mapped by the model cannot be easily interpreted, as could be the genre of a movie for instance.\n",
    "- It suffers from a \"cold start\": when a new user appears, the system is not able to produce good recommendations until a minimum number of ratings have been made.\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, a good approach would be to complete a collaborative filtering model with features extracted from user and items information, thus using a more content-based approach. Overall, the main objective remains to find a good tradeoff between computational complexity and precision of recommendations."
